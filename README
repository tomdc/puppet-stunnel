puppet-stunnel

Module that installs and preps the use of stunnel.
Mainly built for Solaris, as the CSW package was missing some things to get it to work properly.
So the idea is to check wether these can be added to the package itself.
If $operatingsystem != 'Solaris', then it just installs stunnel.
